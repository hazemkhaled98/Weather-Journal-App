# Weather-Journal-App
A practical project for Udacity FE nanodegree.
The App basically request some data from OpenWeatherMap api storing it in the back-end with the info which the user enters and yet requesting it again (for training purposes) to display it for the user in the front-end.
The back-end uses simple Node.js file and the front-end uses HTML, CSS and vanilla JS.
